# Chatbot AI Project

This project implements a conversational AI chatbot using the "microsoft/DialoGPT-large" model. The chatbot is capable of engaging in human-like conversations and can be integrated into a web-based user interface. The project is structured with a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend logic is implemented in a Google Colab notebook.<br><br>
This project is a part of internship at CODESOFT

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an interactive chatbot that can generate human-like text responses based on user input. The chatbot uses the "microsoft/DialoGPT-large" model, which is a fine-tuned version of GPT-2, specifically designed for conversational tasks.<br><br> The project demonstrates how to integrate a powerful NLP model into a web application, with real-time communication between the frontend and the backend running on Google Colab.

## Features

- **Conversational AI:** Uses "microsoft/DialoGPT-large" to generate dynamic, contextually appropriate responses.
- **Responsive Design:** The chatbot interface is designed to work on various screen sizes.
- **Real-time Interaction:** The chatbot can process and respond to user input in real-time.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple structure allows for easy integration into existing web projects.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS:** For creating and styling the chatbot interface.
- **JavaScript:** For managing frontend logic and handling user interactions.
- **Python & Google Colab:** For running the backend server and handling requests.
- **Ngrok:** For exposing the local server to the internet with a public URL.
- **Transformers Library:** For loading and using the pre-trained "microsoft/DialoGPT-large" model.


## Setup and Installation

### Google Colab Setup

1. **Open the Colab Notebook:**
   - Navigate to the `chatbot.pdf` file and copy paste the code in Google Colab and name it `chatbot.ipynb`.

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Ensure the following libraries are installed in the Colab environment:
     ```bash
     !pip install fastapi uvicorn nest-asyncio pyngrok transformers
     ```

3. **Set Up Ngrok:**
   - Replace `"YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN"` with your actual Ngrok token in the following line:
     ```python
     ngrok.set_auth_token("YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN")
     ```
   - This token can be obtained by creating an account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).

4. **Start the Backend Server:**
   - Run all the cells in the notebook to start the server. The public URL generated by Ngrok will be printed in the output.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Update the Public URL:**
   - Replace the public URL in `script.js` with the one generated in Google Colab:
     ```javascript
     fetch('http://<PUBLIC_URL>/chat', {  // Replace <PUBLIC_URL> with the actual public URL from ngrok
         method: 'POST',
         headers: {
             'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         },
         body: JSON.stringify({ message: userInput }),
     })
     ```

2. **Save the Files:**
   - Save `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` in the in your directory.

3. **Open the Frontend:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to interact with the chatbot.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Backend in Google Colab:**
   - Open and run all cells in the `chatbot.ipynb` notebook to start the FastAPI server and expose it via Ngrok.

2. **Interact with the Chatbot:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
   - Type your message in the input box and click "Send".
   - The chatbot will respond in real-time.
