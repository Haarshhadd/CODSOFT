# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This project implements an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI is designed to be unbeatable, using advanced algorithms like Minimax, with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning, to determine the optimal move at each step.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to explore and understand game theory and basic search algorithms through the implementation of an AI for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. By using the Minimax algorithm, the AI can calculate the best possible moves to ensure that it either wins or draws every game.

This project is part of an internship at CODESOFT.

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI:** The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best moves, making it impossible for the human player to win.
- **Responsive Design:** The game interface adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface with clear messages displaying game results.
- **Customizable:** Easy to modify the gameâ€™s appearance and logic.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS:** For creating the game layout and design.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the game logic and AI.
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Used for making optimal decisions.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Haarshhadd/CODSOFT/tree/Task_2-(Tic-Tac-Toe-AI)/Game_Code
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Game_Code
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start the game.

## How to Play

- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
- The human player uses "X" and the AI uses "O".
- Click on an empty cell to make your move.
- The AI will automatically make its move after yours.
- The game will declare a winner or a draw at the end of each round.
- Click the "Restart" button to play again.
